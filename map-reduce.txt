//The map fonction take the number of line as key and the line itself as the value
map(key,value){
//We create and empty list to store the results 
	List[] result;
	String[] tab = value.split(" ");
	for(int j =0; j < tab.length();j++){
	String word = tab[i];

//For the map we are going to use the column number as a key and the couple line number - word as a value
	res = (j,(key,word));
	result.add(res);
	} 

	return result;
} 


//The reduce takes the sorted key/values

reduce(key,values){
//Values is a list of couple line number - word

// We first sort the value by the line number 
values.sort();

No we just have to print the result 

for (String word : values){
	print word + " " ;
}

//The matrix is transposed
